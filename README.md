All the code is standalone and should be run procedurally from top to bottom. Code to install dependencies is also included. 

For Part 1, a path for the raw data would be required to recreate the results. A link to the processed data is added for download and inclusion in the notebook. The code to preprocess the raw data again is commented out for efficiency. The report for part 1 is added as a docx file in the repository.

For Part 2, the report is included in the notebook itself.
